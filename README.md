This repository contains the code (in R language) that was used to generate all the analyses presented in the manuscript “The burden of post-translational modification (PTM) – disrupting mutations in the tumor matrisome” by Elisa Holstein, Annalena Dittmann, Anni Kääriäinen, Vilma Pesola, Jarkko Koivunen, Taina Pihlajaniemi, Alexandra Naba and Valerio Izzi.

Necessary data are too big to fit in the repository, but they can be downloaded from Zenodo (10.5281/zenodo.4490484) Raw data are also available upon request to the corresponding (last) author.

Code is also available in HTML format at https://rpubs.com/Izzilab/PTM-mutations
